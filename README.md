# Introduction

Climate change has become a global epidemic, with human activities strongly impacting the Earth’s biodiversity, ecosystems, and, ultimately, the atmosphere. This causes tremendous concerns as these climate changes negatively influence other important natural resources such as our terrestrial, oceanic, glaciological, and hydrological ecosystems. As the effects of climate change multiply through the years to come, it is imperative to inform ourselves of its impacts and explore effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project aims to investigate the multifaceted effects of climate change on various environmental ecosystems and provide insights.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

Evidently, climate change is a global issue that requires immediate attention. Our data analysis identifies trends and patterns including greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) per country, and larger causes for the emissions such as diesel and gas used. Our data table allowed for us to easily pull important information based off the Emission Quality Flag ratings, to sort out the amounts of greenhouse gases emitted. Ultimately, with such data, we were able to identify that China, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and USA were the top amongst emitting CO2. The city with the highest emissions per person was Ürümqi (Wulumqi), China. Additionally, we could identify a notable correlation between gas prices and CO2 emissions; higher gas prices are associated with lower CO2 emissions per capita, likely due to reduced fuel consumption. Emissions flag ratings were also mapped out, so that we could easily identify geographic regions with their respective impact on CO2 emissions, with the top producers being North America, East Asia, and Latin America & Caribbean. Ultimately, this highlights the areas with significant impact on the global ecosystem. This underscores the importance of both economic factors and regional policies in addressing climate change. Given this information, we could tackle the problem of climate change more effectively, by narrowing down the many factors that contribute, such as the CO2 emissions per country and regions. We also did some investigating into how the data was collected, specifically which gases were counted as emissions, and found that the most commonly recorded groups were CO2; CH4; N2O, CO2, and CO2; CH4; N2O; HFCs; PFCs; SF6, and the group with the highest average emissions was CO2; CH4; SF6; N2O. With this understanding, we are able to have a much better understanding of our societal development's impact on our ecosystem, in order to develop effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change. It is crucial that we take action now to protect our planet for future generations.
